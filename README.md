# ComputationalModelling
"Computational models can help us translate observations into an anticipation of future events, act as a testbed for ideas, extract value from data and ask questions about behaviours. The answers are then used to understand, design, manage and predict the workings of complex systems and processes, from public policy to autonomous systems."
